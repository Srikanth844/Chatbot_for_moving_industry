How far in advance do I need to book?,"As soon as possible! We recommend at least 2 weeks before your move date, but it depends on the time of the year. We are busiest during Summer months, on weekends, and at the beginning and end of each month.
We recommend locking in a date as soon as possible even if you need to reschedule in the future. We only require a small deposit which transfers over to the new move date if it changes."
What can I do to save time on move day?,"Being prepared and fully ready for the movers before we arrive is the best way to save on time on your move. Check out our free moving checklist for some tips & tricks! For more information, check out our article on the MovingWaldo Website - ""What Influences The Price Of A Move."""
Are there any items I should move beforehand?,"There are a few things we require customers to move on their own. These items include:Flammables / Hazardous Items: such as propane tanks, harsh chemicals, lighters/matches, etc.Items of Extraordinary Value: such as cash, important documents, fine art, jewelry, etc.
If you require any of these items be moved by Jonah’s Movers, reach out to us so we can talk through the details and add an exception to your contract."

What if a problem or issue arises on move day?,"If there is an issue or concern on move day, Call our office right away! (832) 728-6675
While we rarely have problems, if anything does arise, tell us early in the move so we can take steps to resolve it quickly. Being a service, our policy is similar to a restaurant’s policy for food:
If you take a bite and complain we can easily take care of it. But if you finish your plate and complain, it's much harder to take back the service."
What happens if there is bad weather on my move day?,"We typically move in bad weather unless it is unsafe to do so. Being in Houston, it would be impossible to operate any other way. All furniture items will be protected with blankets and shrinkwrap so they don’t get exposed to the elements.In the case of major weather events (hurricanes, ice storms, etc), we may need to reschedule moves or bring on additional movers to expedite the completion of your move."
Which items can you NOT move?,"While we do our best to accommodate every client, we are not authorized to move the following items:
Flammables / Hazardous Items: such as gasoline, lighter fluid,  propane tanks, fireworks, ammunition, bleach, pool chemicals, acid, car batteries, etc.

What forms of payment do you accept?,"We accept cash, checks, and all major debit/credit cards.
Debit/credit card payments (excluding the $100 deposit) are subject to a 3% Processing Fee."
How much coverage should I purchase?,It’s really up to you. Some clients tally up each piece of furniture to get a total value of their goods and purchase the nearest level of coverage. Other clients are just worried about a few expensive items (like a fridge or new bedroom set) and purchase just that level of coverage.
Are there any items not covered?,"Yes! There are certain items that Jonah's Movers will not carry or be liable for unless a special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are endorsed. Please let us know if you need to us move any of the following items:
Items of Extraordinary Value
Flammable or Explosive Items"
What is an item of extraordinary value?,"Items of extraordinary value include, but are not limited to:
Fine art, jewelry, bank bills, coin or currency, deeds, notes, drafts or valuable papers of any kind, postage or revenue stamps, stamp collections, precious stones, articles of particularly inherent value, precious metals or articles manufactured therefrom."
How do you protect my furniture?,"We do everything we can to avoid damages before they happen. We protect each piece of furniture with a combination of shrink wrap, cardboard, moving blankets, or paper pads.Mattresses will get shrink-wrapped to keep the dirt away, glass pieces will typically get cardboard and blankets to protect it, and wooden furniture will get blankets from top to bottom."
Are items going to/from a storage unit covered?,"Any item going to/from storage is limited to the state-required $0.60 per pound per article of liability coverage. 
If only part of your shipment is going to/from storage, just those items will be limited to $0.60 per pound per article while the rest of your shipment can be covered at a higher level of liability coverage if you choose to purchase it."
What is an ‘unregulated’ move and why am I not covered?,"The Texas DMV classifies ‘unregulated’ as a move that does not involve transporting items on our truck. This would include loading/unloading a rental truck or POD, rearranging furniture in your home, or moving apartments within the same building.
Office/corporate moves are also classified as ‘unregulated.’"
Does Jonah’s Movers sell insurance?,"No. Insurance can only be sold by a licensed insurance agent and Jonah’s Movers is not licensed or trained to sell insurance.
We are still liable for the value of your goods while in our care, custody, and control. All moves will have ATLEAST the state-required $0.60 per pound per article of liability coverage"
Can I purchase third-party insurance?,"You always have the option of purchasing insurance from a third-party insurance carrier. Before purchasing, check with your home-owners policy to see if you are already covered."
Why do you offer additional liability coverage?,"We offer additional liability coverage as an optional benefit for our customers. Since every client and move is unique, we want you to have multiple options when it comes to keeping your items protected on move day!"
What if an item is damaged during the move?,"If we happen to cause a damage during your move, your crew leader will take pictures and make a note of the serial numbers and other relevant information.At the end of your move, he will then get a discovery call set up with you and the operations team to we can get the claims process started."
What if I find a damage after the move is complete?,"If you happen to find a damage after the move is complete, give the office a call at (832) 728-6675.
The sales person will get a discovery call set-up with you and the operations team so we can get the claims process started."
How quickly do you respond to & resolve a claim?,"Once we are notified of a claim, we will respond back as soon as possible (usually within 2 business days) to get the discovery call set-up and the claims process started.
Resolution of a claim is very dependent on what was damaged.
Small claims will be resolved as quickly as possible either through a repair, replacement item, or cash settlement.
Claims of high value will need to go through our insurance carrier and can take up to 90 days to be fully resolved."
"What is a ""PM move"" or a ""Flex move""?","Our second move of the day is called a ""PM move"" or a ""Flex move"" because it starts when the crew finishes their morning job. Your crew will give you a call with their ETA before heading out to your location. If you haven’t heard from your Crew Leader by 2 pm, feel free to call the office for an update. If having an exact arrival time is important, we recommend scheduling your move as the first one of the day."
What can I do to reduce damages?,"Make sure all loose items are packed in sealed boxes before your move day. Our job is to protect your furniture by using furniture blankets. Your job is to make sure small items are packed properly in moving boxes. (This will make your move go super fast too!) If you need help packing, we do have a packing service that you can book who will do all the packing for you."
How can I trust that the movers won't waste time?,We live and thrive by good reviews and one of our core values is:  We don't keep movers you don't like. All you have to do is read our reviews to understand that they are efficient and quick.
How long should I expect my move to take?,"If everything’s packed and ready, it usually takes about 4-6 hours to load a 24' truck, and less time to unload. But remember, not every place is a full load. Some things can slow down the move, like loose items not in boxes, long walks from the home to the truck, elevator availability in high-rises, access to loading docks, traffic, and if you want furniture rearranged at your new place. Our experienced movers can give you a rough estimate when they arrive."
Do I have to be present for my move?,"We require an adult present throughout your service that has the authority to make decisions on where you want your items placed. This can always be a friend, partner, or trusted family member. Please note: If this person who is observing the service is not the one paying for the move, we would need a credit card authorization form filled out to charge the correct card at the end of the move."
What happens if everything does not fit in the moving truck?,"Our standard truck is 24' and will hold an average 1,800 foot home. If your things don't fit in one load, we can make more than one trip while your crew is signed in. Customers with large homes often order more than one truck and crew so they can finish quicker. If you are moving long distance and are worried about making multiple trips, we would suggest that you reserve a Super Size (TM) truck. Our Supersize truck is twice as big as our standard trucks and you get an extra guy so your move will be faster. Even with a Supersize, sometimes our clients still won't be able to fit everything in a single load."
What should I do with my pet on moving day.,"Moving can be a real fur-raiser for pets, so why not treat them to a mini-vacay at a friend's place? If that's a no-go, pop your furry friend in a cozy crate and tuck them away in a safe spot. Just remember, steer clear of locking them in a bathroom or closet - we wouldn't want them pulling a Houdini on moving day!"
What happens when it rains of if the weather is bad?,"In light rain, we keep moving because your stuff is wrapped and covered. If it gets too rainy, we'll stop the clock and wait. If it's too dangerous to drive, we'll reschedule and contact you. We're available 24/7 by phone, even in severe weather. For updates, visit our website."
Can you get stuff down from the attic?,"We can help with this if your attic has a proper floor, usually plywood. If it doesn't, unfortunately we won't be able to. Keeping your house and our guys safe is our top priority."
How can I make sure my stuff is in the right place at the end of my move?,What you can do is properly label moving boxes with the intended destination room. Our crew lead and helpers will do a walk with you at the destination to discuss what items go where to make sure they end up in the right spot.
Can my movers assemble and/or disassemble furniture?,Absolutely! Our guys come with all of the necessary tools to do most disassembly/assembly of furniture. 
What should I keep with me on my moving day?,"We kindly ask that you keep cash, jewelry, medicine, important documents, pets, kids, guns, ammo, and anything you may need right away with you. This stuff is way too important to get lost during your move."
How should I label my moving boxes?,"Here's a common way to do so: By room it belongs in (kitchen, kids BR1, kids BR2, master bath), what might be in the box, is it fragile) and on multiple sides just in case something is stacked on it (for ease of finding a specific box). It will also help our guys when they reach your final destination."
How do I measure the square footage of a room?,"A couple of ways to get this information: Check Zillow and search your address. As part of their details, they typically show space by room. If that's not availble, you can get pretty close with a tape measure, measuring Length by width in each room at its longest and widest point. Multiply those 2 numbers and you have an approximate SQFT for the room"
Can you hang TVs or frames on our walls?,"Unfortunately, we do not hang TVs or frames on walls. Our guys do not have the necessary equipment (studfinders, etc.) to do so."
I was hoping to leave items wrapped in moving pads. Can you help with this?,"Sure can! If you purchase moving blankets (either from us or somewhere else), we can wrap and leave items in their protective materials"
What's the most efficient way to pack a house?,"Start by packing room by room, keeping essentials packed separately for quick access. No one wants to dig for important stuff. Labeling boxes with enough detail will greatly help both staging and unpacking boxes. If you have time and space, find a location to stage boxes that make for quicker access to load on the truck.
Or if you really want to hit the easy button, call us and we'll pack it crazy quick!"
Will the movers call me prior to arrival on the day of my move?,"The day before your move, the crew leader will call to confirm details for the next day. 
On the day of your move, when the driver leaves our office, you will receive an ""on my way"" text."
What is the best size box for moving?,"There's no easy answer to this question, but the more you use S/M/L moving boxes from either Home Depot or other retailers, the easier it is for our movers to get them to fit and stack in the truck without needing to play Tetris. These boxes are designed specifically for use in moving."
How many moving boxes will I need?,"That depends upon how many rooms you have. In general, it's good to have 10 small, 8 medium, and 5 large moving boxes per room. Just a heads up, this is only an estimate and may be different based on how much stuff you have in each room.
That depends upon how many rooms you have. In general, it's good to have 10 small, 8 medium, and 5 large moving boxes per room. Just a heads up, this is only an estimate and may be different based on how much stuff you have in each room."
Is 3 Men Movers insured?,"Yes. You can request proof of coverage, also called Certificate of Insurance (COI) from a link in your ""Reservation Summary"" email you received upon booking. It takes seconds to request and receive COI onlline."
What is a Certificate of Insurance?,"When moving into a commercial building or high rise, you may be required to provide a Certificate of Insurance (COI) to the property manager. This certificate is provided by our insurer to confirm that we have the standard levels of coverage required and the building is protected. Many home service companies like movers, contractors and repair companies are required to provide this upon request. It is a very easy way to know you are dealing with a reputable company.
You can request a Certificate of Insurance from a link in your ""Reservation Summary"" email you received after booking your services. It takes seconds to request and receive COI online."
Can you move me out of state?,"We can move you anywhere in the US, but we would suggest you check pricing with a national carrier to save money. Sometimes our customers only want us, and if that is the case, we can move you! Our rates are competitive for neighboring states. Give us a call so we can give you a proposal."
Is 3 Men Movers hiring?,"We are always looking for a variety of experts! Our career page will show you our office positions available. If you're looking to be a mover, please understand that we have a wait list of guys wanting to join our team. If you want to get on the list, start by bringing a valid Texas Driver's License to a 3 Men Movers office near you."
Do all your trucks have a lift gate?,"All trucks come with standard moving ramps. If you need a liftgate, be sure to request it when you book so we can see what we have available."
Do movers bring boxes?,"You can buy boxes from our office locations, the movers do not have them on the truck so you don't miss out on valuable space for your items. If you want to make it easy, order our packing service and they will bring all the boxes you will need."
Do your moving trucks have Toll Tags?,Our crews do have EZ pass tags to use when needed so you can get to where you are going quickly!
Can the packers and movers come at the same time?,"For speed and efficiency for both the packers and movers, we typically have packers come in the day before the move out and if hiring unpackers, the day after the move. Moving is chaotic enough without adding more people in potentially tight spaces."
Can you store my stuff in the truck overnight?,"We get it, sometimes there is a delay in getting into your new place. The carpet isn't dry, the old owners haven't left yet, closing gets delayed. If an overnight hold is necessary, there is an extra fee. Please call the office for details. If you need to store things for more than one night, let us know as we might have some storage options available."
What type of truck do you use?,"Our standard truck is a 24' long box truck and can move an average 1,800 foot home. We also have a Super Size truck that is 48' long and can hold an average 3,500 foot home. The Super Size truck comes with 4 crew members to help you get through a larger job quicker."
How to file a damage claim,"While damages sometimes occur, less than 2% of our moves result in damage claims. Damage claims are regulated by the state and must be done in writing. We try to make this process easier for our clients. Please let us know if something got damaged and we will send you an online form to fill out so you can start the process. If at anytime you feel that we are not holding up our end of the bargain, you can reach out to TxDOT at (800) 299-1700. TxDOT is an advocate for consumers using household movers and offers free mediation services."
What is the best day of the week to move?,"Each individual has different needs for their move. What we can say is that if your schedule has some flexibility, you can save up to $20/hour by being able to move mid-week, as well as having more moving crews to choose from mid-week.  If you're on a tighter budget, you could potentially save $80-120 on a larger home or apartment move."
Can I help the movers?,"The best way to help the movers is to have your belongings as ready to be moved as humanly possible, and communicate your needs room by room with our crew leader. Our guys move quickly, so making sure that kids/pets are looked after and safe will be more than enough help"
Can I ride in the cab of the moving truck with the movers?,"Due to liability issues and space constraints, we ask that you follow the guys in their truck, or lead the way in your personal vehicle"
How do you make sure my items are not damaged?,"Our guys carry a wide variety of safety and protective equipment on the trucks. This includes furniture blankets, runners, shrink wrap. Our guys take great care to make sure furniture is wrapped, floors are protected, and boxes are stacked correctly in the truck to prevent shifting and reducing the likelihood of damages."
Do you offer packing services and packing supplies?,"Yep. Sure do. Our packers will come to your house, armed with all of the necessary boxes, tape, and protective bubble wrap/paper to help you pack. You can call in for details or book online."
Do you offer unpacking services?,"Yes, absolutely we do. We can arrange for our packing/unpacking crews to come in the day after the move to unpack and organize your new digs. If we packed you, we'll even take the boxes with us."
Do you offer storage options?,"We offer perhaps the most convenient portable storage option in Texas, called MOVITS. For a flat rate, our guys will come and load your stuff into a MOVITS container, transport it to our secure, climate controlled facilities in Houston or San Antonio. Call a move expert for details."
What if I have multiple drop off or pick up locations?,"We can handle multiple stops, we just ask that you give us a heads up at the time of booking so that we can factor for it in the quote and notate for our crews. Best way to do this is by booking over the phone with a move expert."
How do I pick the right mover?,"There are two things to consider when selecting a mover:
1. Are they licensed and insured? Check the TXDMV website for info on this.
2. Read their reviews, as this will tell you how well they perform the services, how well they communicate, and what you're getting for your money."
Why should I choose 3 Men Movers as my movers?,"Well, let us brag for a minute! 7000 plus reviews, 4.8 stars, we're good people and great movers, and we've been moving Texas neighbors for almost 40 years. We're not the cheapest, but we consider ourselves the best value in TX."
When do I need an in-home moving estimate?,"You need an in-home estimate if it is a really big house, an out of state, long-distance move, or if there are special circumstances. Call our move experts for details."
Should I tip my moving crew?,"Tips for movers are optional and given when movers provide great service. Tips can be any amount, but like restaurants, people usually tip a percentage of their move, anywhere from 10%-25%. You are welcome to tip in cash, or with a credit card. 100% of your tip will go to your crew. If you don't have the budget for a tip and loved the service, please consider giving your mover a review online and shouting them out by name."
Do you accept checks?,"We accept credit, debit, and cash. Sorry, but we don't accept checks."
Do you charge by the item or by the hour?,"We’ve got a 2 hour minimum for our 24' trucks, and after that, it’s a simple ""pay as you go"" deal. The hourly rate kicks in when our movers/packers arrive and you sign them in. They’ll keep the clock running while they load, transport, and unload your stuff. Plus, we prorate every 15 minutes, so you’re only paying for the time they’re actually working for you."
Can someone else pay for my move?,Absolutely! When the cardholder won't be present to pay for a service we can send a credit card authorization form. This keeps information secure and easy for our crews to process after the move is complete.
Will I be paying my movers during their lunch break?,You'll never be charged for breaks and lunches. The time is tracked and will be removed before you sign out the team.
What forms of payment are accepted?,"You can then pay with cash, credit or debit."
What is a travel fee and why are you charging it?,"At 3 Men Movers, our transparent travel fee covers crew travel to your beginning location and from your end location. You know the cost upfront with no surprises!"
When exactly does the hourly rate start and end?,"The clock starts when you sign in with the moving crew and continues while they safely load your items onto the truck, transport, and unload your items at your new home.

Can you move my washer and dryer?,"Our movers are great at moving but not licensed plumbers, so please have your appliances disconnected before we come. If you need help, you’ll need to sign a waiver.
Connections are a common leak point, so make sure to check washer hose connections at both locations. Replacing connections hoses when you move is smart, like replacing all of the smoke alarm batteries at once smart!"
Can I leave items in dresser drawers?,"Most dressers aren't built to handle the extra weight of clothes and other stuff when being moved, so please empty out all the drawers to keep them safe and sturdy. Thanks!"
What don't you move?,"For our safety and liability reasons, we don't move flammable liquids, chemicals, items over 600lbs, motorized vehicles (ATVs, cars, motorcycles, riding lawn mowers), or guns and ammo. To keep your treasures, medicine, and documents secure, we ask that you keep all prescriptions, jewelry, cash, and important documents with you. "
Can movers move my gun safe?,"We'd love to move your gun safe, as long as it’s empty and weighs less than 600 lbs. Waist-high safes are usually fine. For taller ones, a gun safe mover might be needed. Please make sure the safe is empty—we can't transport ammo or firearms. "
Can you move my pianos?,"We are able to move upright pianos that are under 600 lbs. If it fits in the stairwell safely, our crew will happily move it up or down stairs for you.

We are not able to move grand pianos. Our apologies."
Can your movers unmount my TV?,"We can dismount your TV, but remember this will leave holes in your wall. Also, please have a box ready for your TV so it doesn't get damaged during the move."
Can movers move my stuff in plastic trash bags?,"We’re happy to help load items in plastic trash bags into your personal vehicle. To protect your belongings and maximize truck space, we don’t load trash bags onto our trucks. Thanks for understanding!"

All art should be boxed and bubble-wrapped before loading. Our packing crew can handle this as part of their service."
Can you move my artwork?,"Yes, if the art isn't a masterpiece and is simple home decor. For decorative pieces, we recommend that you box or crate it so it can travel safely in our truck. For master pieces, please call a company who specializes in moving art and can crate your art and move it in a climate controlled truck."
Can you move my plants?,"We can, but we don't recommend it. Your personal vehicle has way more climate control than the back of our truck, and they take up a lot of space for boxes."
Can movers move TVs?,"Sure! Just know that TV's travel best in their original box or a TV box. Home Depot sells great ones with all of the protective materials included. If by chance there's no box, a waiver will be needed."
Can your movers move my gym equipment?,"Yes! We can move home gym equipment if it is properly disassembled prior to our moving crew's arrival and the pieces do not weigh over 600lbs.

Why Use Super Size versus a normal size truck?,"Simply put, when you've got a big house! Our Super Size move can handle up to 3500 sqft in one trip, saving you fuel and extra trip charges. Plus, our big trucks come with a crew of 4 to speed things up, which often saves you money."
What are Super Size move limitations?,"Typically, the only limits comes down to whether or not the truck will fit in front of your house and if we can maneuver in and out of your neighborhood."
Can movers move my cubicle?,"Cubicle pieces are not a problem for our team! We just require that they are not hardwired into the electrical system. Please make sure an electrician disconnects them prior to your movers arriving. Once safely at your new location the movers can reassemble them, but only in the exact manner that they were in the previous location. If you want to reconfigure your cubicles you will need new parts so it is best to call an office furniture company to design the new layout and order new parts."
Can you move my items into storage?,"We'd be happy to move your items into your storage facility. Two things to remember:
1. Make sure you know what time the storage building closes. If it closes early, grab a morning slot.
2. Keep stuff safe by keeping your items wrapped in moving blankets. You can purchase moving blankets from our office or from places that sell moving supplies. Give us a ring to find out more."
Can you load or unload a rental truck?,"We'd love to help you load or unload your rental truck! Since you'll be driving, you'll need to get some moving blankets and ties to keep everything secure and protect your furniture during the trip. You can buy these from us if you'd like. Just a heads-up: since we're not the ones transporting your stuff, our responsibility ends once the truck is loaded."
How can I access my MOVITS while it is being stored?,Call our main line at 713-333-6683 to schedule access to your portable storage. One of the office team members will be happy to assist you. This will require a 24-hour notice and a $29 fee to pull it out for you.

Our MOVITS containers are 20% larger than the largest POD, with 256 more cubic feet. If you need quick access and want to DIY it, PODs may be a better fit for you."
Is your storage climate controlled?,"Yes, it's climate controlled, and monitored with state of the art security."
What Can I Do To Help Facilitate My Move?,"To ensure a smooth move, it’s essential to be prepared. This means boxing and sealing loose items and breaking down furniture like beds, mirrors, or multi-piece items. We cannot break down or assemble cribs under any circumstance. If you haven’t broken items down, the crew can help, but they can’t break down or assemble cribs. It’s helpful to have a plan for where everything will go in your new home and to have access to keys. While you can bring items to the truck, you can’t enter the cargo box or use the ramp or liftgate. Being prepared will speed up your move."
"Do I Need to Empty the Chest of Drawers, Dressers, or Refrigerators?","While we prefer them to be empty, furniture such as dressers and chests of drawers generally do not need to be emptied, provided they contain clothes, linens, towels, and the like. Be aware that dressers and chests of drawers will have to be tipped and sometimes stand upright. Therefore, the contents will be subject to shifting. Items such as nightstands, desks, and cabinets should be emptied of all items, especially items that can spill or break. Refrigerators and freezers should be cleaned out as well."
What is the difference between a binding and a non-binding estimate?,"When you receive a non-binding estimate, keep in mind that it is subject to change. However, these estimates are usually reliable and give you a rough estimate of the cost of your move. Usually, a mover will visit your home to inspect your belongings and give you an estimate. If you add extra items or ask for additional services, the estimate may be revised or voided by the mover. It’s important to remember that the non-binding estimate must be in writing and clearly state that it is non-binding.A binding estimate is a fixed, non-negotiable price that we guarantee will not change. You may still add additional services from us, but the cost for those services will be due at delivery. Binding agreements are always delivered in writing."
What is a Bill of Lading?,"The bill of lading serves as a formal agreement between you and your moving company. It should be provided to you before the movers begin to load your belongings. It is crucial to review the document carefully before signing it, and if there are any errors, discuss them with your movers. Keep the bill of lading in a safe place until your move is complete, all charges are paid, and any claims are resolved. It’s essential to hold onto it as it is a critical document for your move."
What Are the Most Common Types of Insurance For Movers?,"Movers usually offer three types of protection plans for your belongings in case of loss or damage during the move.

The first is limited liability, which is mandatory by law and free of charge. The mover is responsible for up to 60 cents per pound per item for an interstate move.

The second type is added valuation, which enables you to claim the amount based on the current replacement value of the item, less depreciation. The fee for this protection is based on the value you declare for your goods.
The third and most comprehensive coverage is full value, which guarantees the actual cost of replacing or repairing an item without any deduction for depreciation. Before purchasing coverage from the moving company, check your homeowner’s insurance policy to see if it covers your goods during a move, and compare plans."
Are Movers Still Responsible for Broken Items if I Packed the Items Myself?,"Yes. It is possible for movers to repack boxes or cartons that they believe are improperly packed or pose a risk to the rest of the shipment. If loss or damage occurs during transit, the mover is usually responsible. However, the mover may not be liable if the loss or damage was caused by an act of nature, the shipper’s act or omission, public enemy or public authority, inherent vice, or improper packing. Improper packing is considered an act or omission, and any contributory damage caused by the mover would void the common law defense, making the mover responsible."
"Damage Compensation, Insurance, and Worker’s Comp Coverage:","Firefighting’s Finest has policies regarding the release of sensitive company information. We meet the State of Texas standard for compensation for loss or damage, which is $0.60 per pound, per item. This is not insurance, even though some companies may tell you so. We offer Full Value Protection, which carries a higher level of liability. Company policy strictly prohibits the release of our exact insurance coverage, policies, and amounts to a limited number of parties.

Cancellation and/or date changes after confirmation will result in the forfeiture of the deposit, and a new deposit will be required to reschedule the service."
Planning The Moving Timeline: Will My Movers Be On Time?,"If you are the first move of the day, your movers should arrive on time, barring some unforeseen complications. If there is a delay, the crew should notify you. Jobs that are given flex starts have approximate start times that are not guaranteed. The crew will generally arrive at some point during the time frame given to you.
Your crew should call once they arrive at their first job and are able to estimate how long the first move should take. Your crew will call you at least 30 minutes in advance to let you know they are on the way. Since moving jobs can go over or underestimated times, the second and third jobs on their schedules may get pushed back or moved up. It is best to be prepared to move at any time on the day of your scheduled move. If the crew cannot make their initial estimated time of arrival, they will call and update you on the new anticipated arrival time. We will do everything possible to have a crew arrive during the time frame initially given.
It is important that you know not to arrange important dates, meetings, or other events on your move date, just in case a job before you run over. Please allow plenty of open time on your move date to ensure that this does not create any problems for your personal or professional lives."

If the elevator must be reserved, please coordinate with your moving Consultant on the time frame it should be reserved for.
Firefighting’s Finest reserves the right to refuse service in conditions that are not safe, sanitary, organized, or clean for work to be performed. Unsanitary or unsafe conditions, such as bed bugs, infestation, or hoarding, are examples of situations in which Firefighting’s Finest may determine that the move is not safe enough to be performed.

Some of the variables that come into play are; distance between the destinations, the exact size of the home/apartment/office/storage, the distance that the movers have to walk to get your belongings from your home to the truck, different detailed parts and pieces that are needed when disassembling or assembling furniture, how far of a distance the movers will be required to walk from your home to the truck, what floor your located on, and whether the belongings in the home are packed and ready to go. The best tip we can give you to save time and money is to ensure that your items are packed and boxed and ready to go."

Do you move pool tables?,"No, we do not move pool tables."
Do we need to remove the clothing from the dressers?,"Yes, we do ask that you remove clothing and contents from your dressers. The primary reason is because we do not want to damage your piece of furniture and when you move a piece of furniture that is full of items there is more threat of a damage occurring to the furniture. We will provide shrink wrap and moving blankets and padding to protect your furniture."
Do you provide protection for the furniture?,"Yes, we provide shrink wrap for upholstered furniture and moving blankets and padding for other furniture. We do not charge extra to shrink wrap upholstered furniture. We do not provide mattress bags or coverings.
